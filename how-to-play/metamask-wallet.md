# Metamask Wallet

Creating a metamask wallet and buying the HUB token from the market seems complicated for non-crypto users but it is quite an easy process. Most of the actions you see below are one-time actions like creating your wallet. Once you have done with these, you will be able to buy HUB tokens in minutes!

1. Create your metamask wallet
2. Transfer your funds to your wallet.&#x20;
3. Buy HUB token from PancakeSwap
4. **It is done!** Now you can buy your player cards from the market!

### 1. Create a metamask wallet

Go to [Metamask ](https://metamask.io/)and click the "Download Now" button, click install for your browser then add it to your browser.&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/Metamask\_0.png)

You have installed the metamask in your browser. Now you need to create a wallet! Click "**Get Started**". If you already have a wallet, then import your wallet by typing your secret phrase. If you don't have one, click the "**Crete a Wallet**" button.

![Creating a Wallet](../.gitbook/assets/Metamask\_1.png)

Crypto wallets are just like your real wallets. Nobody can access them unless you give them permission. On the other hand, banks have total control of your bank accounts!&#x20;

Freedom comes with a burden and that burden is your secret phrase (aka Private Key)! You have to keep this phrase safe and not share it with anyone. These 12 words are the key to your wallet. The safest and easiest way is to write them on multiple papers and keep them safe. You can keep them on your computer or your cloud (like google drive) but it is unwise if you have a large number of funds! You must use a ledger if you hold a large number of funds. Learn more about ledger [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/ledger-wallet.asp).&#x20;

First, create a password. This is a password to unlock your wallet on your device. Then you will have your secret phrase. **Write it down, and keep it safe!** It is the only key that you need when you import your wallet to another device.

![Secret Phrase](../.gitbook/assets/Metamask\_2.png)

Then you need to insert your key to confirm that you get a copy of it. Select the words in order.

And that's it! You have your wallet! You can open your wallet by clicking the **fox icon** on top of your browser. By default, you will be connected to the Ethereum network.&#x20;

You can see **your wallet address** just under Account 1. If you click it, you copy your wallet address. Now, everyone can send you crypto assets with this address. You can add other networks like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) by clicking the "Ethereum Mainnet" and adding the network by typing the required information. But we have a way more easy way to do that!

![](../.gitbook/assets/Metamask\_4.png)

#### Add Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Network to Your Wallet

Now, we need to add Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network to our wallet. You need to go to [**Chainlist.org** ](https://chainlist.org/)and **connect your wallet** from the top right corner.&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/Metamask\_5.png)

A Metamask notification will show up and ask which account of your wallet you want to connect to. After that, it will ask for your approval to add the network to your wallet.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a usual process when you interact with the blockchain. Every time you do something with your wallet, it will ask for your approval. You need to be sure of what you are approving. Therefore, **check the URL** of the website every time, and **do not connect your wallet to applications/websites that you don't trust!**
{% endhint %}

After you connect to the website, you will see the "**Add To Metamask**" button on the **Binance Smart Chain**. Click the button, approve the transaction, and switch to the Binance Smart Chain Mainnet. And you have added the BSC network to your Metamask wallet with just a couple of clicks!

### 2. Transfer your funds

You can transfer your funds from any exchange that has a connection to Binance Smart Chain to your wallet. We will show it from Binance since it is the most common crypto exchange all around the globe! If you don't have any funds on Binance or any crypto at all, you can visit [this page](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/c780097f75dd450a82d17f1e84153276) to learn about how to register, transfer, and buy crypto in Binance. You should have BNB.

Click your wallet and then overview

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Binance\_0 (1).png>)

Click Withdraw from the top

![](../.gitbook/assets/Binance\_6.png)

Select your crypto to withdraw. We recommend BNB because you will need BNB to pay transaction fees on the blockchain.

![](../.gitbook/assets/Binance\_1.png)

Copy your wallet address from your wallet and paste it into the Address section.

![Copy your address](../.gitbook/assets/Binance\_5.png)

Select the BSC network (blockchain).

![](../.gitbook/assets/Binance\_2.png)

Hit the "Max" on the Amount section or enter the amount that you want to withdraw. Then click the Withdraw button.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Binance\_3 (1).png>)

Get your security codes and enter them. Then submit.

And that's it! You will see your funds in your wallet in a couple of minutes! Now you can buy HUB tokens from the decentralized exchange, PancakeSwap!

### 3. Buy HUB token

You can buy HUB token from [PancakeSwap.finance](https://pancakeswap.finance/). Again, always check the URL twice before you connect your wallet. When you land on the website, click **Swap** under **Trade**.

![PancakeSwap](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_0.png)

You can swap your BNB with HUB tokens on this page. To do that, you need to select the HUB token on the bottom. Click the "Cake" token to change it to HUB.

![Swap](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_1.png)

First, you need to add the HUB token to the list. You need to paste the HUB token's contract address into the search bar to add it.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**The official contract address is not published yet!** Therefore, you **CAN NOT** buy the HUB token at the moment. We will continue with a **test** address for demonstration purposes.
{% endhint %}

You will be able to find the official contract address on our website. When it is available, copy and paste it here and click **import**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_2.png)

PancakeSwap will warn you to check the contract address again. Because anyone can create a token with exact same name and symbol. However, the contract addresses are unique for each token. Therefore be sure that you are using the official contract address. **Again, it is not available yet!**&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_3.png)

Once you import it, you will see the HUB token on the bottom. **Connect your wallet** to PancakeSawp and click the **Swap** button once you enter the BNB amount that you want to swap.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You should leave yourself some amount of BNB to pay network fees. Be sure that you have left at least 5 dollars worth of BNB. For instance, if you have 1.1 BNB, leave 0.1 for network fees and swap 1 BNB. Network fees are about 20-30 cents on average. But you need to hold more than the needed fee to experience a smooth transaction.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_4.png)

Confirm your swap prices and exchange rate.

![](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_7.png)

Confirm the transaction on the blockchain

![](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_8.png)

Once you confirm the transaction, you will see this window. You can add the HUB token to your Metamask wallet to see in your wallet. If you accidentally close this window and can't see your HUB tokens in your wallet, click the "Import Tokens" button in your wallet and paste the contract address of the token. You'll find it at the bottom of your Metamask Wallet.&#x20;

![](../.gitbook/assets/PancakeSwap\_9.png)

Your transaction will be completed in under 30 seconds and you will see your HUB tokens in your wallet! Congratulations! Now you can buy your first player cards from the market. You can check to "[How to Buy Player Cards?](how-to-buy-player-cards.md)" page to see how to do it as well!&#x20;
