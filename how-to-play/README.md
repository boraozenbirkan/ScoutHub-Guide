# How to Play?

You need a full team with 11 players to be a Manager in the game. You can buy your first players from the [markets](../markets.md). You don't have to have any substitute players to start but you can have as many as you wish.&#x20;

After creating your team, you need to decide your formation and other strategies to be competitive in the game. If you can place in higher ranks in your league, you will earn HUB tokens. See the "[Game Mechanics](../game-mechanics.md)" page to learn more about how the game works in detail.

There are many leagues that you can join with your team and succeed in. Every league has different conditions to win but they all have the same point system to calculate your rank in the league. You can check the "[Leagues and Game Modes](../leagues-and-game-modes.md)" page to see all the leagues and game modes and the "[Game Mechanics](../game-mechanics.md)" page to learn more about the point system.

You need a Metamask Wallet and HUB token to buy players to create your team. If you already have a metamask wallet and HUB token to buy player cards, you can go to markets to buy your first players. If you don't know how to create a wallet, you can check the "[Metamask Wallet](metamask-wallet.md)" page.
