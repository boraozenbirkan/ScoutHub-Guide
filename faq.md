#### Q: What is blockchain?

A: Blockchain is **a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system**. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Here are some major impacts of blockchain technology in games:

* **Cheating:** In traditional games, there can be a bug that the developer company couldn't detect and used by a cheater. The publisher companies might only be aware of the hack when it goes viral. But we can detect any harmful event because of the transparency of the blockchain. And not only the developers, but players can also track the whole system and detect any misbehavior in the system and warn the developers! This can not be done without blockchain technology!
* **Ownership:** You don't own anything in the traditional games. You have an account and you earn some items in the game but you don't really own those items. It is all in the hand of the company. But it is changing with blockchain. Once you earn or buy an item in the game such as a player card, you have the true owner of that item. You hold it in your wallet! What it means is that totally up to the community! Let's see what it means!
  * if a traditional game goes down or the company shuts down, you lose everything! All those years, your moments, your money! But it is not the case with blockchain games. Players or any other developer company can create the same or similar game and you can continue your game over there. You don't have to rely on the developer company. You can use your items in other games!
  * As a community, you can use these items in many cases. For instance, you can start betting with each other or even create an app that utilizes your game items! It is all up to you!&#x20;
  * Maybe you have opened a place in the metaverse and you only accept the managers who have diamond players in their team. An elite class of the community.
  * We can continue like that and as you see, the sky is the limit here. Having true ownership of your items opens up a whole new world for you. And opportunities as well ;)
* **Token Economy:** Blockchain gives us to power to create a real economy in our games. You can earn the game token and exchange it for real money. There are some serious economies in some games but they are fragile and don't have much potential to grow. Because everyone knows that it is controlled by the developer company. This brings us to the most important subject, trust.
* **Trust:** In traditional games, you HAVE TO trust the developer company about what they say. But they can print as much as in-game money they want, they can sell rare items without saying anyone, their admins can delete a player's item and that player can't prove that without a video record, and so on. They are the god of their games and you have to trust them. Because there is no way for you to notice what they do. But none of them is not the case in a blockchain game. You can see how many items there are on the blockchain. Whether the developer company produces and even can produce any of the items or in-game money? There is no god in blockchain games. Nobody has any control over the network.
* **Historical Record:** Every game creates its own heroes over time from its community. We all have legendary players in our minds and hearts. Wouldn't it be awesome when you own the item that is used by the legendary player of the game? It is possible now, thanks to blockchain technology. You have the historical record of your item. Who owned it, and where did he/she used it? Was it used in an epic game that everyone remembers? It is all recorded on the blockchain and you know that it is all true and there is no manipulation, thanks to the immutable blockchain technology. Oh, are you the legendary player or maybe you will be? Who knows? But you should know that your story and your memory will be with your items on the blockchain, forever.&#x20;

There are many other benefits of blockchain technology that we are even not aware of. Life is full of surprises and so blockchain. You are the one who will discover it!

#### Q: What is NFT?

A: NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenize things like art, collectibles, and even real estate. They can only have one official owner at a time and they're secured by the Binance Smart Chain – no one can modify the record of ownership or copy/paste a new NFT into existence.

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible is an economic term that you could use to describe things like your furniture, a song file, or your computer. These things are not interchangeable with other items because they have unique properties.
