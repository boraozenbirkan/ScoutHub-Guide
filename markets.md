# Markets

There will be two different markets to buy player card NFTs. Scout Market and Manager Market. Each player card will be sold on the Scout market at first, then managers who bought it from the Scout market can sell those players in the Manager Market.&#x20;

Therefore, when ScoutHub introduces a new club and players, you have to buy its player card from the Scout Market if you want to be the first owner of it. The owners of the rare players would consider selling their highly valuable players at high prices. So, it is really important to be the first owner of these players.

While managers can buy players individually in the Manager Market, they can buy them in three different packages. Every package has different rarities. So, we wish you all the best!
